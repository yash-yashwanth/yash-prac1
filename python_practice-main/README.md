## üß© Project Overview

### 1. Age Calculator
- Uses Python‚Äôs `datetime` module to calculate accurate age in years, months, and days.
- Displays results dynamically through Streamlit.
- Simple, intuitive user interface.

### 2. Mini Programs - 1
Includes:
- Area of a Circle Calculation  
- Vowel and Consonant Counting  
- Subtracting 5 from Numbers Divisible by 5  
- Separating Even and Odd Indices  
- Summing Even and Odd Indices  
- Filtering Cities by First Letter or Numerical Value  

### 3. Mini Programs - 2
Continuation of Python logic exercises focused on:
- String Manipulation  
- List Processing  
- Loops and Conditionals  
- Basic Mathematical Operations  

### 4. NumPy Practice / Python Concepts
- Demonstrates **NumPy arrays** and their core attributes.  
- Explores multiple data types: `int8`, `int16`, `float32`, `complex64`, `bool`, etc.  
- Interactive exploration of array structures, dimensions, and element types.  

### 5. Petrol Price Calculator
- Takes petrol price per liter and liters as user input.  
- Calculates and displays the total payable amount instantly.  
- Demonstrates arithmetic logic and Streamlit I/O widgets.
